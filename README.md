# 🌐 Cloud DDoS Detection & Prevention with Machine Learning

## 📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a cloud-based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) prevention system using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The solution aims to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time, with the ability to learn and adapt to new attack patterns as they emerge.

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ **Real-time DDoS Detection:** Monitors cloud traffic and identifies malicious activities.
- 🧠 **Adaptive Learning:** Uses Incremental Learning Models (ILMs) to continuously learn and improve its defense mechanisms against new attack patterns.
- 🔄 **Hybrid ML/DL Architecture:** Combines traditional ML for known attack types with ILM for novel, zero-day attacks.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Honeypot Integration:** Optionally incorporates honeypots for deep analysis of suspicious traffic.
- 🔍 **Anomaly Detection:** Detects abnormal traffic patterns using anomaly detection techniques.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Traffic logs are continuously collected and processed for feature extraction.
2. **Modeling**: A hybrid of traditional supervised learning and Incremental Learning is used to identify known and new DDoS attacks.
3. **Real-Time Decision Making**: The system employs online learning models to adapt to new traffic patterns in real-time.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Detected attacks are labeled and used to retrain the model, ensuring the system keeps evolving.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-prevention-cloud.git
cd Minor-Project-DDoS-on-Cloud
```

2. Run Setup: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
```bash
bash ./setup.sh
```

<!-- ## 🚀 Usage
1. Preprocess Data: To preprocess traffic data:
```bash
python src/preprocessing/preprocess.py
```

2. Train the Model: To train the ML/DL model for DDoS detection:
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

3. Run Real-time Detection: For real-time DDoS detection using streaming data:
```bash
python src/models/run_realtime_detection.py
```
4. Analyze Results: You can view the logs and performance metrics in the `results` folder. -->


## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- ☁️ Cloud Auto-scaling: Implement an automated cloud scaling mechanism based on detected traffic loads.
- 🕸️ Advanced Honeypots: Use more sophisticated honeypots for detailed analysis of attackers' behavior.
- 🛡️ Attack Recovery: Add an automated recovery process to mitigate damage and recover from attacks faster.
